#BOOLEANS

#The Boolean values true and false represent exactly what youthink they do: true represents something
#that is true, and false represents something that is false. Also, there is Nill that represents “nothing”.
#Everything in Ruby has a return value. When a piece of code doesn’t have anything to return, it will
#return nil.
