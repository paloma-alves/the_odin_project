#BOOLEAN LOGIC

#To determine whether an expression evaluates to true or false, youâ€™ll need a comparison operator.
#There are several provided by Ruby:

# == (equals) returns true if the values compared are equal.
5 == 5 #=> true
5 == 6 #=> false

# != (not equal) returns true if the values compared are not equal.
5 != 7 #=> true
5 != 5 #=> false

# > (greater than) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is larger than the value on the
#right.
7 > 5 #=> true
5 > 7 #=> false

# < (less than) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is smaller than the value on the 
#right.
5 < 7 #=> true
7 < 5 #=> false

# >= (greater than or equal to) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is larger than or
#equal to the value on the right.
7 >= 7 #=> true
7 >= 5 #=> true

# <= (less than or equal to) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is smaller than or 
# equal to the value on the right.
5 <= 5 #=> true
5 <= 7 #=> true

# eql? checks both the value type and the actual value it holds.
5.eql?(5.0) #=> false; although they are the same value, one is an integer and the other is a float
5.eql?(5)   #=> true

#equal? checks whether both values are the exact same object in memory. This can be slightly confusing 
#because of the way computers store some values for efficiency. Two variables pointing to the same
#number will usually return true.
a = 5
b = 5
a.equal?(b) #=> true
