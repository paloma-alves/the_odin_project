# VARIABLES

#Variables are a way of assigning data to names in your programs. You can think 
#of a variable as a box with a label on it: it stores something and has a name
#so that you know whatâ€™s inside.

#This is how to create a variable in Ruby:

age = 18 #=> 18

#You can also assign the result of an expression to a variable.

age = 18 + 5 #=> 23

#Variable names are reusable, so you can assign a new value to a variable at any point in your program. 
#Naturally, doing so will override the original value.

age = 18
age #=> 18
age = 33
age #=> 33

#HOW TO NAME VARIABLES
#Ruby is a language that aims to be natural to read and easy to write.
#Variable names should always be lowercase, and multiple words that make
#up a variable name should be split by an underscore. This is known as snake_case.
